Thi is a example of the Observer patters,

Thre are 3 fruits: apple, mango and banana. Each fruit will act as notification and the human will send the notification 
to the dinosaur. The dinosaur will eat the fruit ie get the notification and handle it accordingly by saying that the 
fruit- wether apple, mango or banana was nice.

Here the dino will receive the notification so that is the customer or observer or subscriber. 

The human will provide the notification to dino so it is the subject . 

The fruits are the notifications. 

The above mentiond case will persists but now there will be 2 dinos : one who eats fruits and another who eats veggies. 

Human will send all the notification for fruits and veggies. But bthe dino has to handle at their end 
how to react to the fruits and beggies notifications in their update methods.
